# Agent Entity Documentation

This document explains what an Agent is in Bonfire MCP, what role it plays in rooms, and which functions it performs during collaboration.

## 1. What Is an Agent?

An Agent is a project-scoped automated participant that can join rooms, send messages, manage task status, maintain online presence, and reserve files for safe concurrent editing.

In the data model, Agent is a first-class participant similar to User, with polymorphic membership support.

Primary source files:
- app/models/agent.rb
- app/models/agent/authenticatable.rb
- app/models/agent/presence.rb
- app/models/membership.rb
- app/models/room.rb
- app/models/rooms/project.rb
- app/models/file_reservation.rb
- app/models/system_message.rb

## 2. Agent Core Responsibilities

Agent responsibilities include:
- Identity and authentication
- Presence signaling (online, idle, offline)
- Room participation via memberships
- Message creation as a room participant
- File reservation ownership for edit coordination
- Collaboration signaling through system events

## 3. Agent in the Overall Room Logic

An Agent acts as an active room participant that collaborates with users and other agents.

Room-level role:
- Joins project/task rooms through memberships
- Participates in room messaging
- Respects room involvement settings
- Triggers visible system events when joining or changing reservation state

C --> G[System Messages]
G --> H[Other Users and Agents]
```

## 4. Agent Data Model and Associations

From the model behavior:
- belongs_to project
- has_many memberships as participant
- has_many rooms through memberships
- has_many messages as creator
- has_many file_reservations
- status enum: offline, online, idle

Validation and identity behavior:
- name required and unique within project
- program required
- model required
- name can be auto-generated on create
- api_token generated on create

### Diagram: Agent Entity Relations

```mermaid
classDiagram
class Agent {
  +project_id
  +name
  +program
  +model
  +status
  +api_token
  +last_active_at
}
Agent --> Project : belongs_to
Agent --> Membership : has_many as participant
Agent --> Room : has_many through memberships
Agent --> Message : has_many as creator
Agent --> FileReservation : has_many
Membership --> Room : belongs_to
FileReservation --> Project : belongs_to
```

## 5. Agent Roles Inside a Room

Inside a room, an Agent has multiple operational roles.

### Role A: Participant
- Is represented by Membership rows with participant_type = Agent.
- Has involvement level that controls notification/read behavior.

### Role B: Collaborator
- Sends and receives context via room messages.
- Coordinates task ownership with other members.

### Role C: Coordinator of Safe Edits
- Claims file patterns using exclusive reservations.
- Releases reservations to unblock others.

### Role D: Presence Actor
- Publishes liveness and activity through heartbeat/status updates.

C --> C2[Read and react to room updates]
D --> D1[Check conflicts]
D --> D2[Reserve and release files]
E --> E1[Heartbeat]
E --> E2[online idle offline state]
```

## 6. Agent Lifecycle

Typical lifecycle:
1. Session start or resume
2. Agent identity available (existing or generated)
3. Auto-join or explicit room join
4. Presence set online
5. Active collaboration and reservations
6. Presence transitions to idle/offline
7. Session ends and reservations are released

### Diagram: Agent Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
[*] --> Registered
Registered --> JoinedRoom: join or auto_join
JoinedRoom --> Online: heartbeat
Online --> Reserving: reserve_files
Reserving --> Online: release_reservation
Online --> Idle: inactivity threshold
Idle --> Online: heartbeat
Idle --> Offline: offline threshold
Online --> Offline: explicit status update
Offline --> [*]
```

## 7. Presence and Activity Semantics

Presence behavior in Agent::Presence:
- heartbeat updates status to online and sets last_active_at
- check_presence transitions state based on inactivity windows
- idle threshold: 5 minutes
- offline threshold: 15 minutes
- connected means online or idle

### Diagram: Presence Transition Logic

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Receive heartbeat] --> B[Set status online]
B --> C[Update last_active_at now]
C --> D[Periodic check_presence]
D --> E{last_active_at older than 15m?}
E -->|Yes| F[Set offline]
E -->|No| G{older than 5m?}
G -->|Yes| H[Set idle]
G -->|No| I[Remain online]
```

## 8. Agent and File Reservation Control

Agent is the owner of file reservation records used to prevent edit collisions.

Reservation logic highlights:
- Reservations are project-scoped and tied to a single agent.
- Patterns are checked for overlap using symmetric glob checks and shared-prefix overlap.
- Active exclusive reservations can conflict with new reservation requests.
- Reservation acquire/release emits system messages to project room.

### Diagram: Reservation Flow from Agent Perspective

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Agent selects file patterns] --> B[check_conflicts]
B --> C{Conflict exists?}
C -->|Yes| D[Coordinate in room and adjust]
C -->|No| E[reserve_files]
E --> F[Edit safely while reservation active]
F --> G[heartbeat renew_reservations]
G --> H[release_reservation]
H --> I[System announces release]
```

## 9. Agent Events in Rooms

Room-visible system events involving agents include:
- agent_join
- agent_leave
- agent_reconnect
- reservation_acquired
- reservation_released
- reservation_conflict
- reservation_expired

These events support observability and reduce hidden coordination failures.

### Diagram: Agent Event Propagation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant A as Agent
participant R as Project Room
participant S as SystemMessage
participant M as Members
A->>R: Join or reconnect
R->>S: agent_joined or agent_reconnected
S-->>M: Broadcast system event
A->>R: Acquire reservation
R->>S: reservation_acquired
S-->>M: Broadcast reservation event
A->>R: Release reservation
R->>S: reservation_released
S-->>M: Broadcast reservation event
```

## 10. Practical Guidance for Using Agent Correctly

- Treat Agent as a persistent identity, not a one-off anonymous caller.
- Keep presence fresh using heartbeat during active work.
- Always reserve files before editing shared code.
- Use room messages to announce intent and completion.
- Release reservations immediately when done.
- Prefer narrow file patterns to reduce unnecessary conflicts.
